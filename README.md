# 🧮 Ultra Basic Calculator (Java)

Ultra Basic Calculator is a simple **Java GUI calculator** built using the **Swing** library.
This project was created for **learning purposes**, focusing on basic Java syntax, object-oriented programming, and event handling.

## ✨ Features

* Graphical user interface (GUI)
* Basic arithmetic operations:

  * Addition (+)
  * Subtraction (−)
  * Multiplication (×)
  * Division (÷)
* Clear (CE) button
* Simple and beginner-friendly code structure

## 🛠 Technologies Used

* **Java**
* **Swing (javax.swing)**
* **AWT (java.awt)**

## 📚 Concepts Practiced

* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* Event handling with `ActionListener`
* Window events with `WindowAdapter`
* Swing components (`JFrame`, `JPanel`, `JButton`, `JTextArea`)
* Manual layout positioning using `setBounds`
* Exception handling with `try/catch`
* Converting text input to numeric values

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure you have **Java JDK** installed.
2. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
   ```
3. Compile the project:

   ```bash
   javac Calculator.java
   ```
4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   java Calculator
   ```

## 🎯 Project Goal

The main goal of this project is to help **Java beginners** understand how to:

* Build a basic graphical interface
* Handle user input through buttons
* Apply simple business logic to a GUI application

## 📌 Notes

* The layout is manually positioned using `setBounds`, which is useful for learning but not recommended for large-scale applications.
* This project can be improved by adding layouts, decimal support, or keyboard input.

## 📄 License

This project is open for study and improvement.
